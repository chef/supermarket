Supermarket is Chef's new community project. Here is a rough roadmap that corresponds to the main outcomes we hope to achieve through improving the Chef community experience:

- ~~Better facilitation for signing and managing Contribor License Agreements (CLA). [#2](https://github.com/opscode/supermarket/issues?milestone=2&state=open)~~
- ~~Storing community member information and presenting it in a more user friendly and manageable way. [#2](https://github.com/opscode/supermarket/issues?milestone=2&state=open)~~
- [*In Progress*] Establishing a low barrier to entry for individuals to contribute and improve the community experience. [#2](https://github.com/opscode/supermarket/issues?milestone=2&state=open)
- [*In Progress*] Improving the Cookbooks API to provide more relevant information about individual cookbooks. [#3](https://github.com/opscode/supermarket/issues?milestone=3&state=open)
- Better organized documentation for various Chef projects. [#4]
- Chef Server cookbook API. [#4]
- Dependency API. [#4]
- Incorporating other community contributions like knife plugins, ohai plugins, and related Chef packages. [#5]
- Improved Cookbook ratings using automatic multifactor metascore instead of voting. [#6]

Continuous Integration
------------
Supermarket is using Travis CI. [View build info](https://travis-ci.org/opscode/supermarket)


OmniAuth
--------

Supermarket uses [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) for
linking OAuth accounts to users. You need to create and
register Supermarket as an application and setup the keys in the `.env` file.

To register GitHub as an OmniAuth sign in method:

1. [Register your application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
2. Make sure the Authorization callback URL has the app's URL with the /auth/github/callback path
3. Add the following to your `.env`:

  ```yaml
  GITHUB_KEY: MY_KEY
  GITHUB_SECRET: MY_SECRET
  ```

where `MY_KEY` and `MY_SECRET` are the values given when you created the application.

### Adding Additional Providers

You can add support for additional OAUTH providers by creating an extractor object in `app/extractors`.

Since each OmniAuth provider returns a different set of information, you often end up with nested case statements to account for all the different providers. Supermarket accounts for this behavior using Extractor objects. Each OmniAuth provider must have an associated Extractor object that extracts the correct information from the OmniAuth response hash into a object with a unified interface.

### lvh.me

Twitter and other OmniAuth providers do _not_ like localhost URLs as callback URLs. Thankfully, there's a special DNS entry, `lvh.me`, that will resolve to localhost. It is recommended that you register your OmniAuth callbacks with `lvh.me:3000` and always browse to `lvh.me` instead of `localhost:3000`.

Requirements
------------

- Ruby 2.0.0
- PostgreSQL 9.3+

Tests
-----

Run the entire test suite (rspec, rubocop and mocha) with:

``` sh
bundle exec rake spec:all
```

### Acceptance tests

Acceptance tests are run with [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). Run `rake spec:features` to run the specs in spec/features. The default `rake spec` also runs these.

When writing a feature, use `require 'spec_feature_helper'` instead of `spec_helper` to require the extra configuration and libraries needed to run the feature specs.

The specs run using [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), which must be installed.

### JavaScript Tests

The JavaScript specs are run with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) and use the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) test framework and the [Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com/)

The specs live in spec/javascripts. Run `rake spec:javascripts` to run the specs, and `rake spec:javascripts:watch` to run them continuously and watch for changes.

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is required to run the JavaScript tests.

Development
-----------

## Using Vagrant (Beginner)

Supermarket includes a collection of Chef cookbooks and a preconfigured
`Vagrantfile` to make it easy to get up an running without modifying your local system.

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

1. Install the `vagrant-omnibus` plugin:

  ```
  vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
  ```

1. Run the server:

  ```
  $ ./bin/supermarket server
  ```

The next time you want to start the application, you only need to run:

```
$ ./bin/supermarket server
```

### Notes

#### About Vagrant

Vagrant uses VirtualBox to run a VM that has access to the application project
files. It syncs your local project files with the VM. Running the
`./bin/supermarket server` command spins up a VM. When you are done running the
application, do not forget to run `vagrant suspend` or `vagrant halt` to give
the VM a break.

You can [read more about Vagrant teardown in the Vagrant
docs](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/teardown.html).

#### Changing the VM Defaults

By default, the VM uses NFS mounted folders, 4GB of RAM, and 2 CPUs. If you are
constrained in any of these areas, you can override these defaults by specifying
the environment variables:

``` sh
$ VM_MEMORY=2048 VM_CPUS=1 VM_NFS=false ./bin/supermarket server
```

By default, Supermarket will be forwarded locally to port 3000. If for some reason
port 3000 is already occupied on your computer you may override this:

``` sh
$ PORT=5000 ./bin/supermarket server
```

Supermarket would then be accessible by visiting http://localhost:5000 in this case.

These variables must be set the _first_ time you run any supermarket command.
After that, they will be persisted. To change them, you'll need to destroy the
Vagrant machine (`vagrant destroy`) and run the command again.

If your operating system supports NFS mounted folders, you may be asked to
supply your administrative password. Please note, sometimes VirtualBox explodes
when trying to mount NFS shares (specifically on OSX Mavericks); although it
will make the application significantly slower, disabling NFS folder sharing can
alleviate an error like:

```text
There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant
for controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.

Command: ["hostonlyif", "create"]

Stderr: 0%...
Progress state: NS_ERROR_FAILURE
VBoxManage: error: Failed to create the host-only adapter
VBoxManage: error: VBoxNetAdpCtl: Error while adding new interface: failed to open /dev/vboxnetctl: No such file or directory

VBoxManage: error: Details: code NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005), component HostNetworkInterface, interface IHostNetworkInterface
VBoxManage: error: Context: "int handleCreate(HandlerArg*, int, int*)" at line 68 of file VBoxManageHostonly.cpp
```

Running `sudo /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart` can help fix
this problem, but sometimes you just can't use NFS mounts with VirtualBox.

#### Guest Additions

If you get an error about Guest Additions, install the `vagrant-vbguest` vagrant
plugin:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

### Switching from Vagrant to Local Environment Development

If you want to switch from Vagrant to your developing locally, you have two
options:

When Vagrant runs `bundle install` it installs the gems into `vendor/ruby/gems`.
This is because of the Bundler config in `.bundle/config`.

1. If you want to continue to install gems in `vendor/ruby/gems`, delete that
   directory and run `bundle install`. This will rebuild the gems with native
   dependencies on your local machine instead of the Vagrant VM.
1. If you want to install your gems system wide, delete the `.bundle`
   directory.


## Local Environment (Advanced)

1. Install Ruby 2.0 (latest patch) using your favorite Ruby manager
1. Install Postgres (from [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) or the [app](http://postgresapp.com/))
1. Install Redis (required to run background jobs)
1. Make sure both Postgres and the Redis server are running
1. Install bundler

        $ gem install bundler

1. Install required gems:

        $ bundle

1. Install required assets:

        $ bower install

1. Configure the [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) keys and secrets.
   See `.env.example` for required keys and secrets to get up and running.
   [`docs/CONFIGURING.md`](https://github.com/opscode/supermarket/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURING.md)
   goes into detail about the not so straight forward configuration that needs
   to happen to get Supermarket working locally.

1. Run the migrations:

        $ ./bin/rake db:create && ./bin/rake db:migrate && ./bin/rake db:seed

1. Start the server:

        $ foreman start

Deployment
-----------
### Deploying with Chef

1. Upload the supermarket cookbook to your Chef server.

        $ knife cookbook upload supermarket -o path-to-supermarket-repo/chef/cookbooks

1. Bootstrap a server as a new node.

        $ knife bootstrap someserver.com -u some-user -N some-node

1. Change the defaults in `chef/data_bags/apps/supermarket.json` and upload this databag to your Chef server.

        $ knife data bag from file apps path-to-supermarket-repo/chef/data_bags

1. Add the supermarket cookbook to your newly bootstraped nodes run list.

        $ knife node run_list add some-node 'recipe[supermarket]'

1. Override any default attributes found in `chef/cookbooks/supermarket/attributes/default.rb` in a role or environment as needed.

1. SSH into your node and run `chef-client` this will deploy supermarket.

        ssh some-user@someserver.com
        chef-client
