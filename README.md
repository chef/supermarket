If you have questions, feature ideas, or other suggestions, please [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/chef/supermarket/issues/new).

This repository has the code for the **Supermarket** application and the omnibus definition used to build the `deb/rpm` packages. Other Supermarket related repositories are:

* [chef-cookbooks/supermarket-omnibus-cookbook](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/supermarket-omnibus-cookbook): This cookbook is used to deploy Supermarket through the Supermarket omnibus package. For details on using this cookbook to install Supermarket omnibus, check out [this webinar by the Supermarket Engineering team](https://www.chef.io/webinars/?commid=164925).

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.7.5
* PostgreSQL 13.4
* Redis 6.2.5

## Development

### Configuration

Configure the [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) keys and secrets. See `.env.example` for required keys and secrets. [`docs/CONFIGURING.md`](https://github.com/chef/supermarket/blob/main/src/supermarket/docs/CONFIGURING.md) page details the *not-so-straightforward configuration* information required to setup Supermarket working locally.

### Local Environment

These instructions are tested and verified on macOS Catalina (10.15).

#### Dependency Services

##### As Docker Containers

1. Install `docker`

    ```shell
    brew cask install docker
    ```

  Ensure you have a *PostgreSQL* version installed on the local filesystem for development libraries to be available for building the `pg` gem. See the instructions for locally running *PostgreSQL* below, however omit the steps where the service is running.

1. Start the docker containers.

    ```shell
    cd src/supermarket
    docker-compose up
    ```

##### As Locally Running Processes

1. Install *Postgres* by following any of the below instructions:

    * Install the [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com/):

      This is probably the simplest way to get *Postgres* running on your mac.  You can then start a *Postgres* server through the GUI of the app. If you go this route, then you'll have to add `/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin/` or the equivalent path to obtain the *pg gem* to build.

    * Through [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

      ```shell
      brew install postgresql
      ```

     When installed through homebrew, *Postgres* often requires additional configuration, see this [blog post](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/three-battle-tested-ways-to-install-postgresql) for instructions. Ensure to start the *Postgresql* server by following the command given below.

      ```shell
      pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
      ```

1. Install *Redis*. You can install it with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Follow the instructions in the install output to start the *redis* server.

    ```shell
    brew install redis
    ```

    Run the *redis* server using command:

    ```shell
    redis-server --daemonize yes
    ```

#### Development Environment

1. Ensure you have *Xcode* installed.

1. Install a Ruby manager. If you don't already have one, you will need a *Ruby manager* to install the appropriate Ruby release, such as:
   * [RVM](https://rvm.io)
   * [Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
   * [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby)
   * or any other Ruby version manager that may come along.

1. Use your ruby manager to install the necessary *Ruby* release. For instructions on this, please see the manager's documentation.

1. Ensure you have the *Supermarket* repo cloned to your machine. If not, clone it.
1. Navigate to that directory.

    ```shell
    cd <supermarket-repo>
    ```

1. Again, navigate to the *src* folder.

    ```shell
    cd src/supermarket
    ```

1. Install *Bundler* gem.

    ```shell
    gem install bundler:2.1.4 --user-install
    ```

1. Install required gems:

    ```shell
    bundle install
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    You might encounter the following errors. The possible fixes are also provided herewith.
     * Error installing gem: ***mimemagic***
     * Fix-> `brew install shared-mime-info`
     {{< /note >}}

1. Create the database, migrate to it, and then seed the database:

    ```shell
    bundle exec rails db:setup
    ```

1. Add required *Postgres* extensions.

    ```shell
    psql supermarket_development -c 'create extension plpgsql'
    psql supermarket_development -c 'create extension pg_trgm'
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    Ignore if the above 2 commands displays error: extension already exists.
    {{< /note >}}

1. Start the server:

    ```shell
    bundle exec foreman start
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    If you receive errors, ensure that *redis* and *Postgres* are running.
    {{< /note >}}

## Setting up Auth

Supermarket uses *oc-id* running on a Chef Infra Server to authenticate users to Supermarket.

IF YOU ARE AN INTERNAL CHEF STAFFER - We will be performing some settings prior to set you up with *oc-id*. Consult the internal wiki on setting up your Supermarket dev environment (or ask a friendly team member!).

{{< note >}}
Authentication currently requires a live Chef Infra Server running *oc-id*. We are working on a solution that would allow a developer to run the authentication locally. Stay tuned.
{{< /note >}}

Create a new application and register it on *oc-id* (I called my application **Application:Supermarket Development**). Set the callback URL to <http://localhost:3000/auth/chef_oauth2/callback> or whatever localhost domain you use.

In your local copy of the *Supermarket* repo, copy the `.env` file to `.env.development`. Open up `.env.development` and replace these values:

  ```shell
  CHEF_OAUTH2_APP_ID=YOUR_CHEF_OAUTH2_APP_ID
  CHEF_OAUTH2_SECRET=YOUR_CHEF_OAUTH2_SECRET
  ```

with these values:

  ```shell
  CHEF_OAUTH2_APP_ID=[Application ID of the oc-id application you just registered]
  CHEF_OAUTH2_SECRET=[Secret of the oc-id application you just registered]
  ```

Restart your *foreman* server.

Now, when you click **Sign In**, you will be taken to your supermarket account with your Chef account!

## SPDX license linking for cookbooks

If a cookbook that has *licenseId*, which is also mentioned in *SPDX license* listed at <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/blob/master/json/licenses.json>, you need to update with respective license URL.

When a new cookbook is uploaded, license url information is fetched from the above link and is updated.

For an existing implementation of supermarket, there is a provision running with some *ctl* commands, for updating the information for cookbooks already there in system.

Following commands are available to update the license URLs for cookbooks:

### Update licenses URLs for all the cookbooks in the system

`spdx-all`

### Update for a single cookbook

`spdx-latest <cookbook_name>`

### Update for a particular version of a cookbook

`spdx-on-version <cookbook_name> <cookbook_version>`

## Tests

Requirements for tests: PhantomJS 1.8, Node.

Run the entire test suite (rspec, rubocop and mocha) with:

```shell
bundle exec rake spec:all
```

### Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests are run with [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). Run `rake spec:features` to run the specs in `spec/features`. The default `rake spec` also runs these.

When writing feature specs, the *Rack::Test* driver is used by default. If the *Poltergeist* driver is required to be used (for example, an acceptance test that uses AJAX), add the `use_poltergeist: true` metadata to the spec.

Some specs run using [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), which must be installed for the test suite to pass.

### JavaScript Tests

The JavaScript specs are run with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) and use the [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) test framework and the [Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com/).

The specs live in `spec/javascripts`. Run `rake spec:javascripts` to run the specs, and `rake spec:javascripts:watch` to run them continuously and watch for changes.

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is required to run the JavaScript tests.

## Background Jobs

[Read about Supermarket's background jobs in the wiki](https://github.com/chef/supermarket/wiki/Background-Jobs).

## Feature Flags

*Supermarket* uses a `.env` file to configure itself. Inside this file are *key/value* pairs. These *key/value* pairs will be exported as environment variables when the app runs, and *Supermarket* looks for these keys as environment variables when it needs to read a value that's configurable.

One of these keys is called `FEATURES` and it controls a number of features that can be turned on and off. Here are the available features that can be toggled:

* tools
* fieri
* announcement
* github
* no_crawl
