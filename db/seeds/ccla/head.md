## Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") V1.0

Based on the Apache Software Foundation Individual Contributor License Agreement V2.0, with modifications.

Thank you for your interest in an OpsCode, Inc. (the "Company"), Open Source Project.  In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the Company must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.  This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Company and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.  This version of the Agreement allows an entity (the "Corporation") to submit Contributions to the Company, to authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees to the Company, and to grant copyright and patent licenses and other rights with respect thereto. Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records
