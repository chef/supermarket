Chef Supermarket is the site for community cookbooks. It provides a searchable cookbook repository and a friendly web UI. Cookbooks
that are part of the Chef Supermarket are accessible by any Chef user.

There are two ways to use Chef Supermarket:

- The public Chef Supermarket is hosted by Chef Software and is
    located at [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/).
- A private Chef Supermarket may be installed on-premise behind the
    firewall on the internal network. Cookbook retrieval from a private
    Chef Supermarket is often faster than from the public Chef
    Supermarket because of closer proximity and fewer cookbooks to
    resolve. A private Chef Supermarket can also help formalize internal
    cookbook release management processes (e.g. "a cookbook is not
    released until it is published on the private Chef Supermarket").
