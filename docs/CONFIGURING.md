# Configuring Supermarket

Supermarket uses [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to handle setting
environment variables. These are the different configurations needed to get
Supermarket running. The default parameters provided in `.env` should be
sufficient to run the test suite.

## Minimum Viable Configuration

It is recommended to set these parameters to valid values to be able to use the
core functionality of Supermarket.

* `GITHUB_KEY` and `GITHUB_SECRET` are generated by registering an application
  on GitHub. A GitHub application is required so that users can link their
  GitHub accounts to their Supermarket account.
* The `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY` is used by Devise for security purposes. When
  developing locally, feel free to set it to anything.
* The `SECRET_KEY_BASE` is similar to the `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY`, but is for
  Rails. Set it to whatever you want in development.
* `CHEF_OAUTH2_APP_ID` and `CHEF_OAUTH2_SECRET` are generated when [registering
  an application on oc-id](https://id.opscode.com/id/oauth/applications/). They
  are needed for authentication via OAuth2. When using the application locally,
  be sure to create an application and set the callback url to
  `http://localhost:3000/auth/chef_oauth2/callback` or whatever localhost domain
  you use.

  **NOTE** oc-id is still a work-in-progress; as such, you may find that you are unable to register an application. If this is the case, see [#425](https://github.com/opscode/supermarket/issues/550) for a discussion on how to bypass OAuth for now.
* `CCLA_VERSION` and `ICLA_VERSION` set the version of the current CCLA and
  ICLA respectively.

### Environment Overrides

If you would like to override the defaults in a particular Rails environment,
dotenv will give the settings in `.env.#{Rails.env}` precedence over those in
`.env`. Supermarket explicitly ignores `.env.development` and `.env.test`. This
means that you could, for example, specify an oc-id app ID and secret for local
development in a way that does not soil your working directory by placing the
following in `.env.development`:

```
CHEF_OAUTH2_APP_ID=MY_DEVELOPMENT_KEY
CHEF_OAUTH2_SECRET=MY_DEVELOPMENT_SECRET
```

## Production Settings

These settings are recommended when deploying Supermarket to a production
environment. Any defaults provided in `.env` should be sufficient for running
the test suite.

* `SENTRY_URL` is the URL for logging for the error logger
  [Sentry](https://getsentry.com/). In development, it is okay not to set it.
* `CLA_SIGNATURE_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` is the email that gets notified when CLAs
  are signed.
* `FROM_EMAIL` is the default sender email address for all Supermarket mailers.
* `S3_BUCKET` specifies the S3 bucket to use to save uploaded cookbook
  artifacts.
* `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are the keys required to put
  files in the above bucket.
* `CDN_URL` Used to configure a CDN URL for use with Paperclip. Downloads
will be aliased with this URL, something like `static.getchef.com`.
* `FIERI_URL` is the URL Supermarket will `POST` to for Cookbook evaluation when
  a cookbook is shared

## Configuring Curry

Curry verifies that all contributing parties on a Pull Request have signed a
CLA. The default values provided in `.env` should be sufficient to run the test
suite.

* `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` is used for interacting with the GitHub API.
  Supermarket uses the GitHub API for CLA signature verification checking.
  Generate a personal access token within Account Settings > Applications >
  Personal Access Tokens. **This must be set to run Supermarket locally.**
* `PUBSUBHUBBUB_SECRET` is used for Supermarket to subscripe to repositories.
  It can be set to anything in development.
* `PUBSUBHUBBUB_CALLBACK_URL` is intended for development and test
  environments. When Curry subscribes to a respository, this URL will receive
  periodic heartbeats from GitHub, as well as notifications of Pull Request
  activity. In production, it is best left unspecified, in which case
  Supermarket will use the `curry_pull_request_updates_url`.
* `CURRY_SUCCESS_LABEL` is the text of the label Curry will add to Pull
  Requests whose contributors have all signed a CLA.

## SMTP Settings

By default, Supermarket will use sendmail to send emails. If any of the below
environment variables are specified, Supermarket will send email via SMTP
instead.

* `SMTP_ADDRESS`
* `SMTP_PORT`
* `SMTP_USER_NAME`
* `SMTP_PASSWORD`

## New Relic Configuration

Supermarket bundles the NewRelic agent and uses two environment variables in
its configuration.

* `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`
* `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`, which defaults to `Supermarket`

## Supermarket Feature Configuration

Certain features of Supermarket can be enabled or disabled using `FEATURES`. The
`FEATURES` ENV variable should be defined as a comma separated list of features to
be enabled. Supermarket supports the following features.

* `cla`, Enables the ability to sign the ICLA and CCLA, as well as Curry
* `tools`, Enables the ability to add and view Chef tools and plugins.
* `join_ccla`, Enables the ability for users to join CCLAs that they don't be long to.
* `no_crawl`, Adds noindex, nofollow meta tags so search engines won't crawl Supermarket.
* `fieri`, Enables the ability for Cookbook Versions to be evaluated by Fieri
  when uploaded
